              <p>
                I booked this trip 3 months in advance when the world seemed to
                be opening up and travel was a thing again. But so much changed
                in that time. Heck, things were changing by the day before I
                departed.
              </p>
              <p>
                I followed the news carefully and weighed the risks. I decided
                to go ahead with the trip and self-isolate in my home for 2
                weeks before going and 2 weeks after returning.
              </p>
              <p>
                The downside of travelling during these times is that your
                destination's attractions and/or restaurants and bars could be
                closed (temporarily due to a potential outbreak, or even
                permanently). This wasn't the case for my experience in Iceland,
                but there were a few places that had to enforce the number of
                people allowed in a space at one time. This made for very empty
                bars and a ghost-town-like atmosphere. It didn't take away from
                the experience, just felt different.

                I departed from Toronto International Airport on December 21,
                2021, and landed in Iceland on December 22, 2021.

                I learned so many lessons from this trip, so I've broken up this
                post into chronological order of events with lessons learned,
                hope you enjoy!

              </h2>
              <p>
                While there is an airport in the country's capital of Reykjavik,
                you will most likely arrive at Keflavik (KEF), Iceland's
                international airport.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is only one flight to Iceland from Toronto via Icelandair
                every day which departs in the evening (about 19:30/7:30 pm) and
                arrives around 06:30 am.
              </p>
              <p>
                I flew Icelandair's
                <strong>Saga Premium Class</strong> (Business Class) and was the
                first person to board. It's such a novel feeling to be the first
                to settle in. Upon boarding, I was offered a pre-boarding glass
                of sparkling white wine. Luckily there was no one seated next to
                me, which, in Covid-times, is a small pleasure.

                Once the plane was in flight, I received their dinner and drink
                menu.

                The appetizer was smoked Icelandic salmon and arctic char with
                dill mayonnaise and fried capers. The entrée I selected was
                turkey steak with Christmas stuffing and salt baked vegetables.
                Dessert was pumpkin pie.
              </p>

                All food and drink from the menu was included in the flight. I
                don't know how many drinks were included but I was not planning
                to get hammered so all I had was the one gin and tonic.

                The plane ride was <em>very</em> hot. It was hot returning to
                Toronto as well. I wore a thick turtleneck top and
                heat-retention fleece leggings because I was taking lessons from
                my 2017 trip to Hawaii when I wore a t-shirt and shorts and the
                plane was super air conditioned. On this flight, it was the
                opposite and I felt like I could've worn that same Hawaii
                outfit.
              </p>
              <p>
                I recommend
                <strong>being prepared for any temperatures on flights</strong>.
                Wear a t-shirt and shorts, and layer over a looser fit
                sweatshirt and pants. Peel back when the flight's temperature
                happens to be set to oven. It was so unbearably hot, I thought I
                was going to pass out. Perhaps the hot temperatures were
                intended to make everyone sleep on the flight, because I nodded
                off to sleep for 10-15 minutes at a time (but not a restful
                night's sleep).
              </p>
              <p>
                Although I was on Business Class,
                <strong>there are no lie-flat seats</strong>. The seats are
                wider than economy. You get a plushier pillow and blanket, and
                there's a footrest under the seat in front of you. But other
                than that, it is more like premium economy on Air Canada. I say
                it's worth it if you're someone with wider hips than say, 38
                inches around.

                Lesson 2: Book a hotel stay for the morning you land
              </h2>
              <p>
                When I landed in Iceland, it was 6:00 am local time, which was
                1:00 am Toronto time.
                <strong
                  >Having not slept and still running on Toronto time, I was
                  exhausted.</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Given that hotels only start checking in people at 15:00/3:00
                pm, <strong>I felt many shades of awful</strong>. I so badly
                needed a shower (after sweating bullets on that plane) and a bed
                to sleep on (the jetlag is real when you can't comfortably sleep
                on a plane).
              </p>
              <p>
                Later on, I researched travel forums to see what people did
                between the awkward 6:00 am landing and the 3:00 pm check-in
                time. Most people said
                <strong
                  >it's totally worth booking an extra night of hotel stay so
                  that you are guaranteed a room when you get in at 8:00
                  am</strong
                >. It might seem like you're effectively "losing" 17 hours of
                hotel stay you paid for the night before, but when you're in the
                state I was in (dirty, exhausted, jet-lagged), you would gladly
                pay the $200 for the luxury.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next time I have an overflight flight anywhere (usually to
                Europe) and I land more than 6 hours before check-in time, I
                will absolutely book an extra night hotel for the privilege of

                Lesson 3: Purchase duty-free alcohol, but budget for restaurant
                and bar experiences
              </h2>
              <p>
                Getting through customs took minutes. You go through Passport
                Control, answer a few questions about how long you're staying,
                show your vaccine documentation and negative covid test result.
                They stamp your passport, and on you go. Before you head to the
                luggage carousel, there's the duty-free shop which was
                well-stocked, spaced out, and well-lit.
              </p>
              <p>
                For ultra-light packers without luggage to pick up, you may want
                to skip this part and go straight into catching a shuttle to the
                city. For people with extra space in their bags, and a penchant
                for alcohol and saving money at the same time, the Duty Free
                Shop is the place to be.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Duty Free shop sells alcohol at prices you'd expect at the
                LCBO or at liquor stores in Canada. For example, a can of 355 mL
                of beer is about $3/can or less at the Duty Free shop. At the
                Vin Budin (the government regulated liquor store), it's about $4
                to $5 a can, depending on the brand. At the bar, the same amount
                of beer is about $18 or $9 during Happy Hour (3-6pm).
              </p>
              <p>
                I have mixed feelings about going wild over the Duty Free shop:
              </p>
              <h3 id="pros-">Pros:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Cheaper than in the city.</li>
                <li>
                  If you're going on a road trip and you're visiting places that
                  won't have liquor stores conveniently located (they don't sell
                  alcohol in grocery stores), having them with you to take into
                  your Airbnb fridge is convenient.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you're not renting a car, it's a lot of extra weight to
                  carry from the airport to your accommodation, and more awkward
                  if you can't check in to your hotel early.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You need to ensure you have a fridge at your accommodation to
                  chill it if it's beer or white wine.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Stocking up on Duty Free alcohol means you're consuming it in
                  your hotel room and unless you're travelling as a couple or
                  friends, it's kind of sad to be drinking alone. Part of
                  vacationing should be enjoying the local restaurants and bars,
                  so budget for that.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Alcohol in Iceland is so expensive because it is intended to
                discourage alcohol use. Some Icelanders look forward to
                traveling abroad just to return and stop at the Duty Free store
                to pick up more affordable alcohol (although there are limits to
                how much they can bring in).
              </p>
              <p>
                I didn't buy a whole lot at the duty free store because alcohol
                is liquid, and liquid can get heavy. Although I had room in my
                luggage, I knew I had to get to the hotel and someone's bound to
                handle my luggage roughly (because they've got places to go and
                no idea what precious liquids you have in there).
              </p>
              <p>
                Plus, you're on vacation! Part of travel is visiting bars and
                treating yourself. Just be prepared to pay around $20 for a pint
                of [okay] beer.

                If you're used to using your phone to navigate anywhere,
                including your own home city/country, then you're definitely
                going to need it when you arrive in Iceland.
              </p>
              <p>
                Picking up a SIM card for data/internet is pretty easy and
                affordable. However, I didn't want to fuss with SIM cards
                because they are so tiny and you can easily misplace them and
                then you're screwed when you return home.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead, I got I got a "pocket Wi-Fi" device from
                <a href="https://iceland.trawire.com/">Trawire</a>, which was
                delivered to a gift shop near my hotel. It needs to be charged
                every night, or turned off when you're not using it so it saves
                battery. It's basically like a cell phone with a SIM card in it,
                always on HotSpot mode (except you cannot call or browse the
                internet with it). It worked out to be about $12 CAD a day, and
                it would've been cheaper had I reserved it more than 2 days in
                advance.
              </p>
              <p>
                After you're done with it, you return it to any post office box
                (there are 2 at the airport) when you're done. The device comes
                with a box that has postage-paid.
              </p>
              <p>
                While hotel WiFi might be enough for some, it really helped me
                get my bearing and find places I wanted to visit within the city
                and in the very remote parts of Iceland. I highly recommend
                pre-booking your device so you can pick it up at the airport and
                use it right away.

                Lesson 5: Take the FlyBus from the airport to the city
              </h2>
              <p>
                I used
                <a href="https://www.re.is/tour/flybus/"
                  >FlyBus Airport Transfer</a
                >
                to catch my shuttle to the city. Their tickets are flexible in
                terms of when you catch the shuttle (due to arrival flights
                potentially having delays), but strict in the time they pick you
                up to go back to the airport.
              </p>
              <p>
                The lowest rate drops you off at the bus terminal, and from
                there you can walk to your hotel or Airbnb. This is a good
                option if your accommodation is less than a 10 minute walk. If
                you're travelling in the winter, and you arrive in the city
                around 9:00 am, it's going to still be dark. And if you have no
                WiFi or offline maps on your phone, it can be a challenge to
                find your hotel.
              </p>
              <p>
                I suggest booking a hotel that is a 15 minute walk max from the
                bus terminal (use Google Maps to estimate walking time). If it
                takes longer than that, walking around with your luggage can get
                aggravating (even if your luggage rolls, because some ground is
                uneven), so opt for the FlyBus Plus option (about $15 extra)
                where additional shuttles will take you close to your hotel.
              </p>

                The ride was comfortable, and it took only 45 minutes from
                pick-up to arrival to my hotel.

                Because check-in is 15:00/3:00 pm, and I arrived at 8:00 am, I
                dropped my luggage off at the front desk Alda Hotel on
                Laugavegur street. I chose this hotel for its central location,
                modern decor, and access to a hot tub (because my room only had
                a shower). They were a pleasure to deal with.

                I booked this tour for the start of my trip to help me kill
                time, get a good footing of the city, and it is conveniently
                scheduled at 12:30 / lunch time. You get to taste 10
                restaurants' food (appetizer sized) and it is a great
                introduction to all of Reykjavik's popular restaurants
                (especially ones that are hard to book around the holidays).

                I was very jet lagged but fed and happy. The tour was awesome.
                Ben was an excellent tour guide and kept everyone engaged with
                facts and history about Iceland while we ate. My favourite
                restaurant was Messinn where I tried mashed fish which is like
                mashed potatoes but made of fish. It was sooo good. The famous
                Icelandic hot dogs were delicious too, served with deep fried
                onion bits.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wouldn't recommend doing it the day you land in Iceland if you
                have an overnight flight. If I could do it all over again, I
                would do this the day after I land.

                I skipped the 5th and last stop of the food tour because I was
                absolutely dead tired. I thanked Ben for his time and he
                proceeded to take the rest of the group to Café Loki which I
                visited on my own later on. I walked back to my hotel to collect
                my luggage and check in!

                  Economy Double room at Alda Hotel (that throw pillow is
                  hilarious)

              <p>
                I booked the Economy Double Room placed on the 2nd floor facing
                Laugavegur street, which was noisy up until 10pm after which it
                was pretty quiet until 8:00 am.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is suitable for a couple (there were 2 robes, 2 twin
                mattresses put together and 2 duvets) but even for a solo
                traveller like me, it was still tight. When I sat on the toilet,
                my knees grazed the shower stall door. There is a desk, a big
                red sitting chair (not pictured), and a TV.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a sauna and hot tub and it was really nice. It is free
                to use as often as you like if you are staying at the hotel.
              </p>
              <p>
                I took a shower, unpacked, and by then it was 16:00/4:00 pm. I
                took a nap and woke up around 17:00/5:00 pm. By this time, sun
                had set but the night is young in Reykjavik! I grabbed my camera
                and headed out to take some night street photos.
              </p>
              <p>
                I brought only 2 lenses with me. I know in an earlier post I led
                you all to think I only brought 1 lens, which was the 20mm
                f/2.8, but, surprise! I ended up bringing the 16mm f/2.8 and the
                nifty 50mm f/1.8. I also packed a 70-300mm but reserved that for
                landscape shots on the Ring Road which I'll share later on.
                These 2 lenses + my camera body fit nicely into a small purse.

                Because I was stuffed from the food tour, and my body clock was
                just so messed up, I just ate instant oatmeal and some fruit
                from the grocery store.

                      Scotland. I visited with my partner, mother-in-law, and
                      brother-in-law in spring 2023 so I'll have tips here on
                      traveling with an adult family. I knew nothing about
                      Scotland or its history before my trip, and as someone who
                      soaks in history differently,
                    </p>

                      Aside from the obvious passport and the shoes on your
                      feet, there are 5 things I never travel or fly on a plane
                      without. Some of these might surprise you! Noise
                      Cancelling Headphones Your headphones have to say "noise
                      cancelling" or else you'll hear the person next to you
                      snoring
