                Cycling around a city has several benefits. You get to cover
                more ground than you would on foot, and you get to see it at a
                bite-sized pace. Especially when you've been eating all the
                things in Japan, this is a great opportunity to burn off all the
                calories and keep you in top shape to eat more onigiri!
              </p>
              <p>
                I had a fantastic time on the <strong>North Tour</strong>, which
                lasted approximately 5 hours. There are shorter and longer tours
                which cover various destinations.
              </p>
              <h2 id="where-to-stay-before-the-cycle-kyoto-tour">
                Where to stay before the Cycle Kyoto tour
              </h2>
              <p>
                Book a hotel near <strong>Kyoto Station</strong> so that you can
                have a leisurely breakfast to fuel up before the cycling tour
                because you are going to need it. I booked a couple nights at
                <strong>Henn na Hotel</strong> near Kyoto Station, which was
                just a 4 minute walk to Cycle Kyoto's headquarters.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being close to Kyoto Station also means you can hop on the
                bullet train and go anywhere, especially if you have a JR Pass.
                You'll learn more about the best places to stay in Kyoto in
                another post in the future, but as it relates to where to
                position yourself before the Cycle Kyoto tour, Kyoto Station is
                the spot.
              </p>

                Here is where you will meet up with your tour guide and pick up
                your bicycle.

                Our tour guide, Jamie, went over the route, rules, customs, and
                hyped us up! Two other Canadians joined us on our tour and they
                spoke highly of the Osaka tour led by the same tour company,
                which we did as well.

                Jaime is a passionate tour guide from Chile who spoke fluent
                Japanese and lived in Japan for almost a decade, if not more. He
                engaged with locals and translated his conversation to us to
                give us a sense of life in Kyoto.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout the tour and during stops, he would give us a
                thorough run down of history, culture, and customs. He weaves
                humour with seriousness, even though he probably had done the
                tour over a hundred occasions. He spoke about Kyoto with great
                passion and joy.

              <p>
                This attraction gets super busy at peak times. According to our
                guide, during Golden Week, it would take 2 hours just to line up
                and buy an admission ticket! With the Cycle Kyoto tour,
                admission is included and our tour guide was able to get us
                tickets fairly quickly probably through advanced booking.

                Gion has seen a huge surge in tourists in the past decade and it
                probably won't die down. We cycled to Gion, but did not cycle
                through it. This is important to note because Gion is so busy
                and packed, and laneways are narrow.

              <h2 id="tips-when-on-this-tour">Tips when on this tour</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Wear comfortable shoes. The tour cycles to Gion, but not
                  through it, so you will be exploring Gion mostly by foot,
                  which means a lot of walking. Not all path ways have been
                  maintained so there will be some bumpy grounds your feet will
                  have to navigate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bring a hip/belt bag. Cycling with a backpack full of gear is
                  not ideal because you'll be cycling for a minimum of 3 hours.
                  Only do it if you've done it before and you're used to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Be quick about getting your pictures of the Golden Pavilion.
                  Ideally, spend up to 3 minutes getting your photos and move
                  on. There are lots of other attractions within the park to
                  check out!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Read up on customs at temples and shrines. This tour visits
                  quite a few of them and you should be aware of what you should
                  and should not do.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bring a hat! The tour started out cloudy but then the sun came
                  out and it was hard to ride a bicycle with the sun glaring
                  into the eyes.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
              <p>
                I went on this tour on a Tuesday in November, so there were
                fewer tourists than if we went on a weekend or a peak season
                like Golden Week or Cherry Blossom season. I highly recommend
                planning your cycling tour around October, November or December,
                when the weather is mild, and chances of rain are low.
              </p>
              <p>
                A cycling tour is super helpful to get a high level view of the
                city if you plan to only spend 1-2 nights. You can pick and
                choose where you want to return afterward, which was what we did
                after for some of the stops like Kamo River and Gion.
              </p>

                      Castles! History! Outlander! All valid reasons to visit
                      Scotland. I visited with my partner, mother-in-law, and
                      brother-in-law in spring 2023 so I'll have tips here on
                      traveling with an adult family. I knew nothing about
                      Scotland or its history before my trip, and as someone who
                      soaks in history differently,

                      Aside from the obvious passport and the shoes on your
                      feet, there are 5 things I never travel or fly on a plane

                      Cancelling Headphones Your headphones have to say "noise
