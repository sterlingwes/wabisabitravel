                Since international air travel is still restricted, staying in a
                cabin is relatively safer when it’s just yourself and a partner
                (whom you've been living with since the start of the pandemic).
              </p>
              <p>
                Enter Cabinscape: an off-grid cabin, typically powered by solar
                energy and water pumped from nearby stream. We stayed in one of
                these for two nights in late May. This post is applicable to any
                cabin, but the one we stayed in in particular was called the
                "Dashi".

                We brought our dog for an extra pet fee. I have a section below
                on dogs that you might find helpful!
              </p>
              <h2 id="first-day">First Day</h2>
              <p>
                A day before you check-in, the owners email you a guide on
                navigating the cabin, water usage, and the lockbox code to enter
                the cabin.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we arrived, the space was clean and stocked with all the
                supplies we needed for two nights: toilet paper, kitchen
                utensils, and even a propane barbecue.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a 3.5 hour drive into the cabin, the first thing we did
                was unpack and fire up the barbecue!
              </p>
              <p>
                The cabin is designed efficiently, making use all the space. The
                vertical height is utilized with shelves and hooks all the way
                up to the ceiling.

                Because check-in is at 3:00 pm, you're going to want supper.
                Make sure you pack enough food for 3 days and 2 nights (for a 2
                night stay). So that's going to be 2 suppers/dinners, 1 lunch,
                and 2 breakfasts. Check-out is 11:00 am so don't linger to make
                lunch.

              <p>
                The tap water is pumped directly from the stream below so it is
                recommended for only washing your hands. They provide you 20
                litres of drinkable spring water that they replenish after each
                guest stay. If you have the space in your vehicle, bring extra
                jugs of water from your own home if you’re a heavy consumer of
                water (or if you plan to make anything on stove top like pasta,
                eggs, soup). You could technically just boil the tap water, but
                it is up to you.

                We brought a cooler with food purchased from our hometown
                instead of purchasing them locally since we needed to limit the
                spread. There was a mini fridge if we wanted to keep anything
                cold, but to conserve the solar battery, we chose to leave it
                unplugged. Ideally, bring your own cooler filled with reusable
                ice packs. Our cooler was able to keep things cold for more than
                24 hours so we did just fine keeping frozen meats in there
                overnight.

                On the last/third day the meats started to get thawed and mushy
                if not properly refrigerated so it’s best to cook up all your
                food for the first 2 days/nights and have something you can eat
                without cooking (like a bread and nut butter, veggie sticks and
                dip, or cheese and crackers).
              </p>
              <p>
                Don’t forget condiments like ketchup and mustard! The
                typical-sized bottles take up a lot of space in the cooler, so I
                would recommend putting however much you need in a smaller jar
                or bottle. Alternatively if you have take-out condiment squeeze
                packets lying around and not expired, bring those and dispose
                the packaging responsibly (toss in a bag and bring home with
                you).

                The cabin had bowls, plates, pots and pans, utensils, cutlery,
                and barbecue tools. If you’re so inclined to bring your own,
                feel free. It's a good idea to bring your own barbecue grill
                cleaner paddle because the wire brush they have has seen better
                days. Whatever you bring, don't be too precious about them
                because you might forget them after washing and leaving them to
                dry! Just remember to spot check the drying rack before you
                leave.

              <p>
                Drinks will probably take up the most space in your cooler.
                Ideally, bring a bag-in-a-box wine that doesn’t need to be
                served cool (i.e. red wine) if you’re into drinking that. I
                highly recommend Nero Red Wine from The Wine Rack (it’s a dry
                red!).<br />If you’re into cocktails, prepare to bring waterless
                ice cubes or a bag of ice cubes. If cold spirits, beer, and wine
                is that important to you, bring a separate cooler for that.

              <p>
                Every off-grid cabin is equipped with a solar energized-battery
                for lights.<br />Because there is no sewage system, there is a
                composting toilet. You must sit down on the toilet to do your
                business, because the toilet seat compression opens the flap to
                receive your poop and pee. There is no other elegant way to put
                that. It goes into a compostable bag that gets emptied before
                the next guest. So in a way, it’s like a port-o-potty, but there
                is a fan inside that blows the stank outside. It never smelled
                bad every time I used it. You can bring your own air fresheners
                if you want that new car smell.

                There is NO WI-FI. There is some cell service available, but
                you’re encouraged to explore the forest or read a book. It’s the
                perfect getaway from the city and from other people. The
                Instagram stories can wait when you’re back in the city with all
                the other basic folks.

                To access one of the two beds, you need to climb a ladder bolted
                to the wall adjacent to it. It can be a bit tricky and scary to
                get up there.

                Once up in the loft, the bed was comfortable. They felt like the
                ones from Casper or Endy. There were pillows but if you have a
                special one, bring it. While they had sheets on the mattresses
                that they change after every guest, you should bring your own
                sheets to cover them. I brought blankets while my partner
                brought his sleeping bag.

                At times it felt cold with temperatures dropping to 13 degrees
                celsius, but not unbearable. An insulated sleeping bag is really

                We explored the wooded area around the cabin. There were some
                mosquitos, so I would suggest bringing some bug spray. Bring
                hiking boots as the terrain can be tough to navigate with
                running or walking shoes. I also brought rain boots as there was
                rain while we were there and I was trudging through a lot of
                mud.

                There’s a deck around the cabin, so you can bring a yoga mat and

                I know some of you are big coffee drinkers so this section is
                for you. The cabin includes a French press. I personally don’t
                like making coffee with a French press because I dislike the
                clean-up.
              </p>

                I brought my own Melita pour-over cone, grind, and paper
                filters. I ground the beans and stored them in a resealable
                container. I kept the used paper filters in a green waste bag
                that I brought back home to dispose of in my own green waste
                bin. If you bring a reusable filter, remember to bring a small
                brush or new toothbrush to scrape the grind out.

                For milk, I could have brought a small 250 mL milk carton from
                the convenience store, but I wanted to minimize entering stores.
                I didn’t want to bring a 2L carton of milk, so I poured about
                250 mL or 8 oz into a Swell bottle, which keeps liquids cold for
                24 hours. I kept the bottle in the cooler and it kept cool for 3
                whole days!

              <p>
                There was sugar in the cabin, but I like to use brown rock sugar
                so I brought those sugar packets you can get at the milk/sugar
                area at Starbucks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes late at night I felt like drinking tea. There is a
                kettle provided so you just fill it with drinking water (or
                stream water, if you’re so inclined) and heat it up on the gas
                stove. Keep an eye (or ear!) on it because it’s the kind that
                whistles rather than auto shuts-off. While they provided some
                green tea bags, I have preferences when it comes to tea, so I
                brought my own.

              <p>
                While I recommended bringing small packets of things, you have

              </p>
              <p>
                The cabin has one medium-sized garbage bin that fills up
                quickly. They had a supply of large garbage bags, but it’s
                better to contain stinky meat trays and wrap them up in small
                plastic bags. With larger garbage bags you will feel inclined to
                only tie up when it gets really full and that does not keep
                smells at bay. If you’re going to bring stuff that will
                definitely stink overnight like fish on styrofoam trays, bring
                some baking soda to sprinkle on them after use so that they
                absorb any odours.
              </p>
              <p>
                You must bring your garbage back to your home. Sort your
                recycling, garbage, and organics where possible and dispose
                according to your municipal requirements.

                Remember to bring multiple towels for each day and wash them
                when you return home. Our dog also got into the stream and had a
                swim, so big towels are also a necessity. If your dog likes to
                play fetch, bring a rubber ball that you can rinse off easily
                rather than those fuzzy tennis balls.

                As for letting your dogs roam around, it’s best not to for the
                first day. Get a good bearing of what’s around (e.g. animals,
                potential sharp rocks or traps, etc.). Also, if they run around
                and poop, you will never be able to find where they pooped! So
                keep a close eye on your dog when they’re running around. Fit
                them with a blinking collar or high-visibility vest when they’re
                loose.
              </p>
              <p>
                For fun, I’d like to strap a GoPro on their back, and see where
                he gets up to! Though if they lose it from excessive shaking,
                good luck trying to find it! Strap on a cheap one and let them
                go.

                Fire pit fires near the cabin are the best! Just remember to
                supply your own firewood (can be obtained from a hardware store
                or gas station), or bring dry non-painted corrugated cardboard.
                Do NOT try to burn things like plastic water bottles.
              </p>
              <p>
                We saw some left over in the fire pit from previous guests and
                that's just terrible. Anything you burn should be dry and as
                organic as possible. There are matches in the cabin, but it's a
                good idea to bring your own too.

              </h2>
              <p>
                Because there was only an outdoor shower and it sprayed only
                cold water, I didn’t shower the entire time I was there (yes,
                gross). Instead, I took a shower just before heading to the
                cabin, and used baby wipes to wipe myself down each day.
              </p>
              <p>
                If I knew the weather was going to be warmer (like above 28˚C),
                I would pack small versions of my favourite shampoos in little
                reusable tubes. But note that this cabin was under a tree canopy
                so the temperature was much lower than what you’d see noted in
                weather apps.

              <p>
                The one we stayed in this year was the Dashi cabin, and it had
                an outdoor shower, and loft bed and main level bed. We stayed in
                another one called the Juniper, which had an indoor shower but
                only one main level bed. Both had similar sized kitchen and wash
                areas.

                Absolutely! This being our second time with
                <a href="https://www.cabinscape.com/">Cabinscape</a> we'd love
