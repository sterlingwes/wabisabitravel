Never really had a reason to. Except for Rammstein.</p><p>I&apos;ve been a fan of their music for over 20 years. I&apos;ve never seen them perform live. Until now.</p><p>Alright, more on Rammstein later.</p><hr><p>I booked my flight through Icelandair and did a 3 night stopover in Iceland on my way from Toronto. More on that stopover later.</p><p>The flight from Iceland to Berlin was smooth, but boy, was I in for a heatwave! Especially coming from Iceland (Reykjanes peninsula) where the hottest temp was 20&#x2DA;C, I was boiling in my long sleeves and long pants.</p><p>I&apos;m going to go through my trip by category, rather than a chronological itinerary:</p><h2 id="hotels">Hotels</h2><p>I checked into Mondrian Suites near Checkpoint Charlie. Only stayed here for a night because I had mixed up dates and messed up. My stay was only 85 Euros, or $125 CAD. There was NO AIR CONDITIONING. I was boiling and could not get good sleep at night.</p><p>For the rest of my stay in Berlin, I stayed at <a href="https://www.easyhotel.com/hotels/germany/berlin/berlin-hackescher-markt">easyHotel in Hackescher Markt</a>. It&apos;s a hotel chain by the same low cost airline, easyJet. And you guessed it &#x2013; they charge for every little thing. But I&apos;m a no-frills kind of gal. I don&apos;t need daily room cleaning; I don&apos;t even need a hair dryer. And yes, the hotel rooms do not have hair dryers. There are no toiletries except hand soap (and I&apos;m pretty sure the body wash is the same liquid as the hand soap).</p><p>They only give you 1 towel and 1 bath mat towel. You can request more and they won&apos;t charge you for that. If you need a hair dryer, you rent it for a 10 Euros deposit and you get that money back if you give it back (it&apos;s not worth keeping, trust me).</p><p>They also charge you 3 Euros to leave your bag locked in a locker if you happen to arrive earlier than your check-in time. Yup. Every little thing. I don&apos;t mind though! There&apos;s a lot of &quot;extras&quot; that I really don&apos;t need. I am particular about my toiletries anyway, so I don&apos;t need hotel-offered things.</p><p>When I travel solo, all I care about is having a clean, safe, private room with a clean private bathroom that I don&apos;t need to share with everyone else. Everything else is a bonus.</p><h2 id="food">Food</h2><ul><li><a href="https://freabakery.de/">FREA Bakery</a>: one of the best vegan bakeries I&apos;ve ever visited. All espresso-based drinks come made with oat milk by default &#x2013; which is a DREAM.</li><li><a href="https://sammysberlinerdonuts.de/?lang=en">Sammy&apos;s Donuts</a>: right across the street from easyHotel in Hackescher Markt and I went there twice during my trip. It was just an easy option for a decent flat white and sweet treat (plain glazed donuts &#x2013; I&apos;m boring, whatever)</li><li><a href="https://www.cocobanhmideli.de/">C&#xF4; C&#xF4; b&#xE1;nh m&#xEC; deli</a>: located on Rosenthaler, near easyHotel, and this was one of the most filling and cheapest food options. Pho, banh mi sandwiches, and tofu salads were so comforting to have when I craved Vietnamese food.</li></ul><h2 id="beer">Beer</h2><p>Authentic run-of-the-mill German beer isn&apos;t the greatest. Trust me on this. Here are the spots for quality craft beer:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.themutedhorn.com/">Muted Horn</a>: owners are from Canada, so there were a lot of familiar options from Toronto (Bellwoods Brewery, Blood Brothers). They are also an independent craft beer bottle shop. Canadian craft beer is sold at a steep premium (2x) so unless you&apos;re an expat missing home, I would suggest you buy it in Toronto. For example, a 500 mL bottle of Grandma&apos;s Boy from Bellwoods was selling for 18,50 Euros ($27 CAD), whereas in Toronto it&apos;s $14 CAD.</li><li><a href="https://www.homebarberlin.com/">HOME Bar</a>: great spot for IPAs located on Neue Bahnhofstra&#xDF;e.</li><li><a href="https://salamisocialclub.de/">Salami Social Club</a>: great spot for sourdough-based pizza and American-style IPAs</li><li><a href="https://www.braeugier.de/standorte/gastropub-ostkreuz/">Br&#xE4;ugier Taproom Ostkreuz</a>: this spot is nice when the weather is good. They open up all the windows and doors and it&apos;s such a nice and breezy space.</li></ul><h2 id="things-to-see-do">Things To See / Do</h2><ul><li><a href="https://en.darkmatter.berlin/">Dark Matter Art Exhibit</a>: basically a night club for quiet people who like sit/stand/not dance</li><li>Get your photo taken by a local photographer. I hired <a href="https://www.instagram.com/heyitsduo/">Duo Chen</a>.</li><li>Get a <a href="https://www.berlin-welcomecard.de/en">Berlin WelcomeCard</a> to gain access to various museums and attraction at a discount or for &quot;free&quot; (it&apos;s up to you to exercise your right when you purchase the pass).</li><li>If you&apos;re a public transit nerd like me, ride all the trains and trams!</li><li><a href="https://www.ddr-museum.de/en">DDR Museum</a>: an interactive, immersive experience of everyday life in the former East Germany</li><li><a href="https://tv-turm.de/en/">Berlin TV Tower</a>: (warning &#x2013; this is not an accessible attraction. Not friendly to people who use wheelchairs!)</li></ul><h2 id="tours">Tours</h2><p>I did a couple day tours. A craft beer one and a bicycle tour. Both were fine, but they were hosted by expats. Nothing wrong with that, but I was not super keen on their perspective as expats and preferred to learn from someone who had grown up in Berlin and could share their experiences of how Berlin evolved since their childhood.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.berlincraftbeerexperience.com/">Berlin Craft Beer Experience</a>: I liked that this one had small group sizes. I was in a group of 6. Felt like a group of friends by the end of the night. Other tour groups have bigger groups and it can feel like you&apos;re part of a lumbering group of annoying tourists, so I recommend smaller group sizes if you can inquire in advance.</li><li><a href="https://berlinonbike.de/en/">Berlin on Bike tours</a>: I liked the different neighbourhoods we visited, but they also take you to very crowded touristy spots. It&apos;s great if you&apos;re short on time and want to see all the highlights.</li></ul><h2 id="videos">Videos</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2SBRTOkcay0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Summer in Berlin | part 1 | travel vlog"></iframe></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9hYlnDRwwA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Summer in Berlin | part two | a travel vlog full of eating and drinking and art"></iframe></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wMclbv4fCJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Summer in Berlin | Rammstein Live aus Berlin | travel vlog | part 3"></iframe></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Scotland â€“ 9 Day Itinerary]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Castles!

History! Outlander! All valid reasons to visit Scotland.</p><p>I visited with my partner, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law in spring 2023 so I&apos;ll have tips here on traveling with an adult family.</p><p>I knew nothing about Scotland or its history before my trip, and as someone who soaks in history <em>differently</em>, I watched all 6 seasons of Outlander and it was a good introduction (even if the show is fiction, based on a series of novels written by an American woman who had never been to Scotland &#x2013; still, she was granted an honourary doctorate from a Scottish university for her contributions).</p><p><em>Of course, always refer to more official and non-fiction sources of history to augment your learning.</em></p><p>I chose to visit in the spring time when it was considered the most &quot;dry season&quot; &#x2013; end of April to early May. This also happens to be cherry blossom season in Edinburgh, so while the suckers shell out $$ to see them in Japan, you can enjoy them with a side of haggis and a dram.</p><h3 id="glasgow">Glasgow</h3><p>We spent 2 nights here. While we could&apos;ve spent more time here, Glasgow is a city, and cities can be expensive. Some top sights:</p><h3 id="tenement-house-museum">Tenement House Museum</h3><p>I loved this museum so so so much. It&apos;s basically a house that belonged to a single old woman who never threw anything away. But golly, thank goodness she did not, because everything is treasure. For more details on admission and hours, check out the <a href="https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/the-tenement-house">National Trust for Scotland website</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2023/06/JCJ_0665.jpeg" width="1200" height="800" loading="lazy" alt="Scotland &#x2013;

We missed out on a few sights because of construction/site closures. We did not get to visit Neist Point Lighthouse or Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls.</p><p>We rented a cottage through VRBO (Vacation Rental By Owner), about a 10 minute drive from Portree. It was a convenient location from town to get groceries at the local Co-Op (there are 2 &#x2013; there&apos;s a bigger one and a much smaller convenience-store-sized one).</p><p>We hired / rented a car through Fort William Car Hire. A word about driving in Scotland: it is much easier to drive in the rural areas if it&apos;s your first time driving on the other (left) side of the road. If you rent a car from a city, you need to deal with driving with others in the city which can be daunting. Rural areas are a bit quieter and with less traffic to contend with.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2023/06/PXL_20230428_133450581.jpeg" width="1200" height="900" loading="lazy" alt="Scotland &#x2013;

Some of these might surprise you!</p><ol><li><strong>Noise Cancelling Headphones</strong><br>Your headphones have to say &quot;noise cancelling&quot; or else you&apos;ll hear the person next to you snoring or the baby nearby crying. Some headphone brands are becoming sneaky and using different terms to trick you into think they&apos;re noise cancelling, but end up not being soundproof enough! I use Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones that go over the ear for a secure fit.</li><li><strong>AirFly Pro</strong><br>If I want to watch the in-flight entertainment, they most likely only have a headphone jack and not compatible with Bluetooth. This device pairs your Bluetooth device and plugs into the in-flight entertainment system. Just be sure to charge it before you go. It takes USB-C which hopefully most of your electronics already have.</li><li><strong>Plastic bags</strong><br>On the plane, I never put things in the seat pocket in front of me because those things never get cleaned. If I need it to hold my things, I put it inside a clean plastic bag as a barrier between my things and the dirty seat pocket.</li><li><strong>Power bank / external battery pack</strong><br>Even if your new phone boasts an all-day battery life, you are going to be using it more often to be taking videos/photos and it will drain it faster. You are also likely going to be turning on the GPS/Location services or using your phone to look up Maps, all which also drain battery. Though some encourage an &quot;always be charging&quot; philosophy, you might not always find a secure spot to charge your phone. And you should never plug in your phone into some random USB port which might download all your phone&apos;s information and leave you open to security vulnerablities.</li><li><strong>Hydration tablets</strong><br>Plane travel means dry cabin air, and travel in general means you will break a sweat if you&apos;re not used to walking 20,000 steps a day. Drinking water is more effective when you have electrolytes included. Hydration tablets that you drop into your water have really helped me especially during hot summer days or hiking treks.

How to make it, how to spend it, and whether something is &quot;worth it&quot;.</p><p>I got into a debate in an Instagram reel (lol) about how much it costs to travel (from North America to Europe). The original poster said it cost her about $3500 for 2 weeks with a friend. I chimed in to say &quot;that&apos;s accurate, and it cost me closer to $5000 as a solo traveller who stayed alone in hotels in Switzerland&quot;. I thought it was helpful to share a different side! And for some reason, the internet did not like that &#x1F602;</p><p>I had one random person with a protected account tell me that I was promoting &quot;luxury travel&quot; and that she&apos;s solo travelling Germany and her Airbnb only cost $500 for 2 weeks. Great! I&apos;m happy for you. But don&apos;t label my experience as luxury &#x1F480;</p><p>Maybe I needed to preface every money-related thing with this:</p><ul><li>I am a person who has worked in the tech industry</li><li>I am privileged (I have been able to save up)</li><li>I prefer to stay in hotels with a private bathroom</li><li>I prefer to eat out instead of cooking while I&apos;m on holiday</li><li>I prefer direct flights with reserved seats as opposed to flights with connections/layovers/low-cost airlines</li><li>I prefer visiting European countries with higher standards of living where a beer costs $20</li></ul><p>Also, note, I am flying to Europe from North America. Across an ocean. Of course it&apos;s going to cost more. If you&apos;re already living in Europe and you&apos;re taking a train to another European country, you can&apos;t tell me &quot;oH bUt I oNlY speNd 10 Euros a dAy oN MY TRIP&quot;.</p><p>I live in the middle of nowhere where I cook all meals. I rarely eat out. So why would I do something I already do the rest of the 50 weeks a year? I need to give myself a break!</p><p>Missing connections and sitting in the middle seat of a 3-seater is not fun. I know my limits of wakefulness. I know lack of my ability to sleep on planes. I will pay money to avoid or mitigate the shittiness of that.</p><p>Budgets hit nerves because it is a comparison rabbit hole. People apply their biases, privileges, and circumstances to the conversation. People sometimes fish for compliments over how they&apos;ve been able to &quot;price hack&quot; and be a &quot;smart spender&quot;. But is spending $30 more a night for a hotel room going to harm your long-term financial position? Sure, it adds up. But at the end of the day, it&apos;s about what you value (to spend more) and what you&apos;re willing to put up with (to save).</p><p>I always cost out my travels. I spreadsheet everything down to the coffee I&apos;ll buy every day. And I add 25% for incidentals or things I didn&apos;t expect to come up. I spend more, and I do it responsibly. I set a limit and play within it.</p><p>Travel is a choice and privilege. It can be a luxury, depending on who you ask. And if you want my opinion and match my style of travel, it&apos;s going to cost the above. If you think I overspend, great! That&apos;s not going to change my choices. You can do it your way. No one dies in the end!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Switzerland â€“ 8 Day Solo Travel Itinerary]]></title><description><![CDATA[Visited Switzerland in September as a solo traveller, exploring the Jungfrau region, including Lauterbrunnen, Wengen, MÃ¼rren, Grindelwald, Kandersteg, and ZÃ¼rich.]]></description><link>https://wabisabitravel.com/switzerland-8-day-solo-travel/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">631ddc2ab27aa109ad757b97</guid><category><![CDATA[Cycling]]></category><category><![CDATA[Switzerland]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Justine]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 20:07:27 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/JCJ_6531b-1.jpeg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/JCJ_6531b-1.jpeg" alt="Switzerland &#x2013; 8 Day Solo Travel Itinerary"><p>I just returned from an 8 day trip to Switzerland in early September 2022.

Lauterbrunnen is about a 30 minute train ride from Interlaken Ost, which is a major &quot;artery&quot; train station in the Jungfrau region. You can reach Interlaken Ost by train from Z&#xFC;rich, and it takes about 2-3 hours depending on the train routes you take.</p><p>The first night focused on decompression, and overcoming a very long (8 hour) train ride from Dusseldorf, Germany. I stayed in a private room at Valley Hostel. It cost CHF 86.80 ($115 CAD) per night, not including breakfast. I opted out of the breakfast option because I was going to do an early hike before the serving time.</p><p>In all honesty, I didn&apos;t like staying in a hostel even thought I had a private room. I&apos;m just not one for shared washrooms, people bending the no-shoes rule by wearing their outside sandals indoors, and the noise &#x2013; oh god the noise. My room was above the reception area so the door kept slamming and shaking the building and I couldn&apos;t get any sleep. If I paid $5-10 more per night, I could&apos;ve had a private bathroom and some peace and quiet.</p><h2 id="kandersteg">Kandersteg</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/JCJ_6183b.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Switzerland &#x2013; 8 Day Solo Travel Itinerary" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/JCJ_6183b.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/JCJ_6183b.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/JCJ_6183b.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/JCJ_6183b.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Oeschinensee Lake</figcaption></figure><p>The day after, I headed straight to Kandersteg, where I took the gondola up to Oeschinensee and hiked to the lake. It is a small lake but very picturesque. The trip from Lauterbrunnen is between 1.5-2 hours each way. I budgeted the entire day for this day trip so that I wouldn&apos;t feel rushed or overtire myself.</p><p>From where I was staying in Lauterbrunnen, I took a train back to Interlaken Ost, then to Kandersteg. From the station I walked 10 minutes to the gondola lift station and reached the top of the mountain a few minutes. From there, it&apos;s another 15-20 minute walk to reach Oeschinensee.</p><p>There are a couple restaurants at Oeschinensee with great lake views.</p><h2 id="m%C3%BCrren">M&#xFC;rren</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/PXL_20220902_073310422b.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Switzerland &#x2013; 8 Day Solo Travel Itinerary" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/PXL_20220902_073310422b.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/PXL_20220902_073310422b.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/PXL_20220902_073310422b.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/PXL_20220902_073310422b.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Hotel Alpina in M&#xFC;rren</figcaption></figure><p>Murren is a small, car-free village that is a short cable car and train ride away from Lauterbrunnen. I stayed here for a night at the Hotel Alpina. I had a single room with a private bathroom and a balcony that had the most imposing mountain view. The room was CHF 95, or $125 CAD.</p><p>From M&#xFC;rren I walked about 15 minutes to the cable car station that went up the Schilthorn&#x2013;2,970-m. peak in the Bernese Alps. The Schilthorn had a revolving restaurant called the Piz Gloria. </p><p>I also took the Allmendhubel funicular which is much smaller and shorter, but is popular amongst children due to its playgrounds. There are some smaller hiking trails from here too. I visited here very briefly because it started to rain.</p><h2 id="grindelwald">Grindelwald</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/PXL_20220904_064809318b.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Switzerland &#x2013; 8 Day Solo Travel Itinerary" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/PXL_20220904_064809318b.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/PXL_20220904_064809318b.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/PXL_20220904_064809318b.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/PXL_20220904_064809318b.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Riding the cable car up to Grindelwald First</figcaption></figure><p>I made my way from M&#xFC;rren to Grindelwald which took about 1.5 hour.

The single room cost CHF 106 ($140 CAD) per night.</p><p>As soon as I dropped off my bag, I walked 10 minutes to First (pronounced &quot;fierce-t&quot;) and rode the cable car up to the top of the mountain. I rented a bicycle for CHF 45 ($60 CAD) and rode down to enjoy the scenery. It seemed cloudy and forecasted some rain, but it only drizzled. The ride down took about an hour because I stopped every so often to take pictures. I dropped off my bicycle at the rental branch at the bottom of the mountain.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/PXL_20220903_102122668b.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Switzerland &#x2013; 8 Day Solo Travel Itinerary" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/PXL_20220903_102122668b.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/PXL_20220903_102122668b.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/PXL_20220903_102122668b.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/PXL_20220903_102122668b.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Bicycle with a not bad view from Grindelwald First</figcaption></figure><p>The next day I went up to First again and this time I hiked to Bachalpsee Lake. This hike took 1 hour (can be shorter if you don&apos;t stop to take pictures every so often like I did), and I spent about 30 minutes admiring the destination. Then I hiked back and saw the Cliff Walk was very busy so I opted to take the cable car back down.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/PXL_20220904_084632680-2b.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Switzerland &#x2013; 8 Day Solo Travel Itinerary" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1498" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/PXL_20220904_084632680-2b.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/PXL_20220904_084632680-2b.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/PXL_20220904_084632680-2b.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/PXL_20220904_084632680-2b.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Bachalpsee Lake, hike from Grindelwald First</figcaption></figure><p>The next morning before checking out of the hotel, I took an early cable car back up to First again to do the Cliff Walk. It was almost empty. There is a hotel at the top of First which I almost booked but it would mean I&apos;d be limited to the cable car schedule if I wanted to return late or leave early. Of course, you can hike down but that would take at least an hour or two.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/JCJ_6531b.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Switzerland &#x2013; 8 Day Solo Travel Itinerary" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/JCJ_6531b.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/JCJ_6531b.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/JCJ_6531b.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/JCJ_6531b.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>At the Grindelwald First Cliff Walk viewpoint</figcaption></figure><p>Note about Grindelwald: it is a very built-up town with the conveniences of a large Coop grocery store, pharmacy, restaurants, and souvenir shops. I do not recommend staying here if you want peace and quiet, unless you secure a hotel further out from the main station. My hotel was a 3 minute walk from the main Grindelwald station which was convenient, but didn&apos;t realize there was an outdoor music festival happening right outside. There was loud country music until 11:00 pm and I wanted to sleep earlier.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/JCJ_6450b.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Switzerland &#x2013; 8 Day Solo Travel Itinerary" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/JCJ_6450b.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/JCJ_6450b.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/JCJ_6450b.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/JCJ_6450b.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>On my balcony of the Central Hotel Wolter in Grindelwald</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, I think Grindelwald is a great place to spend 2-3 nights!</p><h2 id="wengen">Wengen</h2><p>I journeyed an hour from Grindelwald to Wengen, where I spent my last 3 nights. I stayed at the Hotel Alpenruhe, which is a &quot;vintage design hotel&quot;. It cost CHF 131 &#xA0;($173 CAD) per night.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/PXL_20220905_094637674b.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Switzerland &#x2013; 8 Day Solo Travel Itinerary" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/PXL_20220905_094637674b.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/PXL_20220905_094637674b.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/PXL_20220905_094637674b.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/PXL_20220905_094637674b.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Hotel Alpenruhe Vintage Design Hotel in Wengen</figcaption></figure><p>This was my favourite hotel of the entire trip. The decor reminds me of a Wes Anderson movie, full of midcentury modern furniture, minimalism, and subtle details that don&apos;t upstage the gorgeous balcony views of the Jungfrau.</p><p>The bathrooms have original tilework which are very retro and reminiscent of your grandma&apos;s bathroom from the 1970&apos;s. The place was clean and impecable. I opted in for the breakfast option and it had so many cheese options I wish I could eat them all.</p><p>From Wengen, I ventured up Mannlichen, Kleine Scheidegg, Harder Kulm, Lake Brienz, and Schynige Platte. Wengen is a very good place to situate yourself for day hikes and scenic train rides.</p><p>The train ride from Wilderswil to Schynige Platte is a scenic train ride on a very old train. It moves very slowly (10 km/h) so it takes about an hour each way. Budget a morning or afternoon for this, including hikes once you get to Schynige Platte.</p><p>On my last night in Wengen, I hiked up to Leiterhorn which was about 30 minutes from my hotel (or 45 minute hike from the main Wengen train station if you&apos;re staying at another hotel). Leiterhorn has incredible, sweeping views of the Lauterbrunnen valley and Jungfrau. Just look at this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/JCJ_6638b.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Switzerland &#x2013; 8 Day Solo Travel Itinerary" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/09/JCJ_6638b.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/09/JCJ_6638b.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/09/JCJ_6638b.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/09/JCJ_6638b.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>The view on the way to Leiterhorn from Wengen</figcaption></figure><h2 id="z%C3%BCrich">Z&#xFC;rich</h2><p>On the morning of check out, I took my time waking up and had a leisure, slow breakfast. </p><p>From Wengen I journeyed to Z&#xFC;rich which took about 3 hours. I checked into the Radisson Blu Hotel at the airport because I had an early morning flight the next day. The room cost CHF 188 ($250 CAD). I could&apos;ve stayed in the city because it was only a 10 minute train ride to the airport, but prices for hotels were the same and I wanted to minimize any chance of potentially missing my flight home.</p><p>After dropping off my bag, I decided to do a self-tour of all the best craft beer bars in Zurich. I went to Bierwerks Zuri which is a short walk from the main Zurich train station. Then I made my way to BierLab where they had a LoverBeer tap takeover (they are an exclusive brewery from Italy) and enjoyed a flight of their beers.</p><p>I ended the night with a few more drinks at Norden, a new bar that specialized in beers brewed by Nordic countries (Norway, Finland, Sweden, Greenland, Iceland, Faroe Islands). I had a great time chatting with Salma, a bartender who had been with Norden since the beginning of its opening in 2020.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So that was my trip! I wouldn&apos;t change anything about my trip but if I were to return, I would stay in M&#xFC;rren and Wengen longer.</p><p>For the entire time I was in Switzerland, I got the Berner Oberland Regional Rail Pass which offered unlimited rides on almost all cable cars, trains, and funiculars within the area of validity. The only time I had to pay was to go up the Schilthorn but it was discounted 50% off (regularly CHF 88, but with the rail pass it was CHF 44).</p><p>I went the first week of September and the temperatures hovered around the 10-20&#x2DA;C range, with some periods of drizzling rain. I did not have to pack any puffer jackets and did quite fine with my fleece zip-up jacket under a rain/windbreaker.</p><p>Doing carry-on only helped lower any anxieties around lost luggage and only packed a few articles of clothing that I washed every night and hung to dry in the hotel bathrooms. Quick-dry clothing is key to pull this off successfully.</p><p>Switzerland is not cheap, but reasonable for what you get to see and explore. I budgeted <strong>$5000 CAD</strong> for my entire trip (including flights, meals, rail pass, accommodations, and random sundries/souvenirs) and I came under budget by about $80. </p><p>It might sound over indulgent for a solo traveler, but I hold a certain standard of comfort (no 8-bed hostels, no cooking &#x2013; I am on vacation!!, and no 2 hour hikes in the sun if I can get up by a cable car in 20 minutes).

It&apos;s quite appropriate that the tour designated Egilssta&#xF0;ir as a halfway point between H&#xF6;fn and Akureyri because I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any other town that&apos;d have amenities for tourists to get food/drink, etc. Driving through looked like there were a lot of rural areas.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to say this was a boring day, but, it was a boring day.

From the main parking lot area, tour guides take you on a very rocky Jeep ride to another parking lot which takes 30 minutes. After getting crampons on, you walk another 30 minutes to the ice cave. Once there, it takes about an hour to do the ice cave tour, itself. Then another hour to hike back to the parking lot and get on another rocky Jeep ride. Tip: Don&apos;t drink too many liquids before this tour because there are no restrooms at the ice cave!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144624151.jpeg" width="1500" height="2000" loading="lazy" alt="Iceland &#x2013; Day 5: H&#xF6;fn, Vatnaj&#xF6;kull, J&#xF6;kuls&#xE1;rl&#xF3;n Glacier Lagoon, Crystal Ice Cave Tour" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144624151.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144624151.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144624151.jpeg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144825413.jpeg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Iceland &#x2013; Day 5: H&#xF6;fn, Vatnaj&#xF6;kull, J&#xF6;kuls&#xE1;rl&#xF3;n Glacier Lagoon, Crystal Ice Cave Tour" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144825413.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144825413.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144825413.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144825413.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144956559.jpeg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Iceland &#x2013; Day 5: H&#xF6;fn, Vatnaj&#xF6;kull, J&#xF6;kuls&#xE1;rl&#xF3;n Glacier Lagoon, Crystal Ice Cave Tour" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144956559.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144956559.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144956559.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/03/PXL_20211226_144956559.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/03/PXL_20211226_145016841.jpeg" width="2000" height="1500" loading="lazy" alt="Iceland &#x2013; Day 5: H&#xF6;fn, Vatnaj&#xF6;kull, J&#xF6;kuls&#xE1;rl&#xF3;n Glacier Lagoon, Crystal Ice Cave Tour" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/PXL_20211226_145016841.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/PXL_20211226_145016841.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/PXL_20211226_145016841.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/03/PXL_20211226_145016841.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>The cave is naturally occurring and never the same each year.

However, the bus overhead compartment storage is way smaller than a plane. It&apos;s about a phone height of space so you can&apos;t put anything up there except maybe a book. If you ride one of these busses, I advise you bring a small day pack with whatever you need (water, medication, snacks) that you don&apos;t mind keeping on your lap throughout 2-3 hour driving stretches.</p><p>At 8:00 am, the moon was still out and sun only rises around 11:00 am during winter months.

Day 2: Reykjavik &#x2013; Lopapeysas, Braud, Fishmrkt, &#xDE;&#xFA;fa"><p><em>I visited Iceland for 2 weeks in December 2021. Check out my <a href="https://wabisabitravel.com/tag/iceland/">other Iceland posts here</a>.</em></p><p>I planned 3 nights in Reykjavik at the start of my trip so that I had ample buffer time before my small-group tour around the Ring Road. Before the start of any tour, it&apos;s always recommended to book at least a night stay. Why? Your flight could be delayed. Or, there could no available transportation to your tour meeting spot due to weather. Or, your luggage could take forever to come off the carousel. A whole host of things could make you miss your tour start. It&apos;s so important to book a place to shower, unwind, and get adjusted before you start exploring.</p><p>Day 2 was my favourite! It was <strong>December 23</strong>, and for Icelanders it is the most lively day of the holidays.

It stank, and you can only imagine what it smells like in the summer. </p><p>There were no railings and I was feeling cautious so I opted to just stay on the ground and watch dad and brother make it to the top.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/JCJ_2122.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Iceland &#x2013; Day 2: Reykjavik &#x2013; Lopapeysas, Braud, Fishmrkt, &#xDE;&#xFA;fa" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/JCJ_2122.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/JCJ_2122.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/JCJ_2122.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/JCJ_2122.jpeg 2000w"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/JCJ_2126.jpeg" width="2000" height="1333" loading="lazy" alt="Iceland &#x2013; Day 2: Reykjavik &#x2013; Lopapeysas, Braud, Fishmrkt, &#xDE;&#xFA;fa" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/JCJ_2126.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/JCJ_2126.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/JCJ_2126.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/JCJ_2126.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/JCJ_2128.jpeg" width="2000" height="1333" loading="lazy" alt="Iceland &#x2013; Day 2: Reykjavik &#x2013; Lopapeysas, Braud, Fishmrkt, &#xDE;&#xFA;fa" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/JCJ_2128.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/JCJ_2128.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/JCJ_2128.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/JCJ_2128.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/JCJ_2130.jpeg" width="2000" height="1333" loading="lazy" alt="Iceland &#x2013; Day 2: Reykjavik &#x2013; Lopapeysas, Braud, Fishmrkt, &#xDE;&#xFA;fa" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/JCJ_2130.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/JCJ_2130.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/JCJ_2130.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/JCJ_2130.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><p>It was a 45 minute walk from the city center to get to that art installation, and we weren&apos;t in the mood to walk 45 minutes back, so we decided to try out Reykjavik&apos;s public transit system, Str&#xE6;t&#xF3;.

And tax is included in the price. In North America, the price you see is always before taxes and tip which is so sneaky and I don&apos;t like that. So if you buy a bowl of ramen in Toronto and it&apos;s priced $14, it&apos;s really going to end up being $20.

This wasn&apos;t the case for my experience in Iceland, but there were a few places that had to enforce the number of people allowed in a space at one time. This made for very empty bars and a ghost-town-like atmosphere. It didn&apos;t take away from the experience, just felt different.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/JCJ_2037.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Iceland &#x2013; Day 1: Keflavik Airport, Reykjavik Food Tour, Alda Hotel" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/JCJ_2037.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/JCJ_2037.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/JCJ_2037.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/JCJ_2037.jpeg 2000w"><figcaption>Reykjavik seaside</figcaption></figure><p>I departed from Toronto International Airport on December 21, 2021, and landed in Iceland on December 22, 2021.</p><p>I learned so many lessons from this trip, so I&apos;ve broken up this post into chronological order of events with lessons learned, hope you enjoy!</p><h2 id="lesson-1-the-airplane-cabin-can-be-hot">Lesson 1: The airplane cabin can be HOT</h2><p>While there is an airport in the country&apos;s capital of Reykjavik, you will most likely arrive at Keflavik (KEF), Iceland&apos;s international airport.</p><p>There is only one flight to Iceland from Toronto via Icelandair every day which departs in the evening (about 19:30/7:30 pm) and arrives around 06:30 am.</p><p>I flew Icelandair&apos;s <strong>Saga Premium Class</strong> (Business Class) and was the first person to board.

It was hot returning to Toronto as well. I wore a thick turtleneck top and heat-retention fleece leggings because I was taking lessons from my 2017 trip to Hawaii when I wore a t-shirt and shorts and the plane was super air conditioned. On this flight, it was the opposite and I felt like I could&apos;ve worn that same Hawaii outfit.</p><p>I recommend <strong>being prepared for any temperatures on flights</strong>. Wear a t-shirt and shorts, and layer over a looser fit sweatshirt and pants. Peel back when the flight&apos;s temperature happens to be set to oven. It was so unbearably hot, I thought I was going to pass out. Perhaps the hot temperatures were intended to make everyone sleep on the flight, because I nodded off to sleep for 10-15 minutes at a time (but not a restful night&apos;s sleep).</p><p>Although I was on Business Class, <strong>there are no lie-flat seats</strong>. The seats are wider than economy. You get a plushier pillow and blanket, and there&apos;s a footrest under the seat in front of you. But other than that, it is more like premium economy on Air Canada. I say it&apos;s worth it if you&apos;re someone with wider hips than say, 38 inches around.</p><h2 id="lesson-2-book-a-hotel-stay-for-the-morning-you-land">Lesson 2: Book a hotel stay for the morning you land</h2><p>When I landed in Iceland, it was 6:00 am local time, which was 1:00 am Toronto time. <strong>Having not slept and still running on Toronto time, I was exhausted.</strong></p><p>Given that hotels only start checking in people at 15:00/3:00 pm, <strong>I felt many shades of awful</strong>. I so badly needed a shower (after sweating bullets on that plane) and a bed to sleep on (the jetlag is real when you can&apos;t comfortably sleep on a plane). </p><p>Later on, I researched travel forums to see what people did between the awkward 6:00 am landing and the 3:00 pm check-in time. Most people said <strong>it&apos;s totally worth booking an extra night of hotel stay so that you are guaranteed a room when you get in at 8:00 am</strong>. It might seem like you&apos;re effectively &quot;losing&quot; 17 hours of hotel stay you paid for the night before, but when you&apos;re in the state I was in (dirty, exhausted, jet-lagged), you would gladly pay the $200 for the luxury.</p><p>The next time I have an overflight flight anywhere (usually to Europe) and I land more than 6 hours before check-in time, I will absolutely book an extra night hotel for the privilege of having a room ready for me.</p><p><strong>Quality of life, people!</strong></p><h2 id="lesson-3-purchase-duty-free-alcohol-but-budget-for-restaurant-and-bar-experiences">Lesson 3: Purchase duty-free alcohol, but budget for restaurant and bar experiences</h2><p>Getting through customs took minutes. You go through Passport Control, answer a few questions about how long you&apos;re staying, show your vaccine documentation and negative covid test result. They stamp your passport, and on you go. Before you head to the luggage carousel, there&apos;s the duty-free shop which was well-stocked, spaced out, and well-lit. </p><p>For ultra-light packers without luggage to pick up, you may want to skip this part and go straight into catching a shuttle to the city. For people with extra space in their bags, and a penchant for alcohol and saving money at the same time, the Duty Free Shop is the place to be.</p><p>The Duty Free shop sells alcohol at prices you&apos;d expect at the LCBO or at liquor stores in Canada. For example, a can of 355 mL of beer is about $3/can or less at the Duty Free shop. At the Vin Budin (the government regulated liquor store), it&apos;s about $4 to $5 a can, depending on the brand. At the bar, the same amount of beer is about $18 or $9 during Happy Hour (3-6pm).</p><p>I have mixed feelings about going wild over the Duty Free shop:</p><h3 id="pros-">Pros:</h3><ul><li>Cheaper than in the city.</li><li>If you&apos;re going on a road trip and you&apos;re visiting places that won&apos;t have liquor stores conveniently located (they don&apos;t sell alcohol in grocery stores), having them with you to take into your Airbnb fridge is convenient.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-">Cons:</h3><ul><li>If you&apos;re not renting a car, it&apos;s a lot of extra weight to carry from the airport to your accommodation, and more awkward if you can&apos;t check in to your hotel early.</li><li>You need to ensure you have a fridge at your accommodation to chill it if it&apos;s beer or white wine.</li><li>Stocking up on Duty Free alcohol means you&apos;re consuming it in your hotel room and unless you&apos;re travelling as a couple or friends, it&apos;s kind of sad to be drinking alone. Part of vacationing should be enjoying the local restaurants and bars, so budget for that.</li></ul><p>Alcohol in Iceland is so expensive because it is intended to discourage alcohol use. Some Icelanders look forward to traveling abroad just to return and stop at the Duty Free store to pick up more affordable alcohol (although there are limits to how much they can bring in).</p><p>I didn&apos;t buy a whole lot at the duty free store because alcohol is liquid, and liquid can get heavy. Although I had room in my luggage, I knew I had to get to the hotel and someone&apos;s bound to handle my luggage roughly (because they&apos;ve got places to go and no idea what precious liquids you have in there).</p><p>Plus, you&apos;re on vacation! Part of travel is visiting bars and treating yourself. Just be prepared to pay around $20 for a pint of [okay] beer.</p><h2 id="lesson-4-connectivity-is-pretty-important">Lesson 4: Connectivity is pretty important</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/PXL_20211222_065347889.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Iceland &#x2013; Day 1: Keflavik Airport, Reykjavik Food Tour, Alda Hotel" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/PXL_20211222_065347889.jpeg 600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/PXL_20211222_065347889.jpeg 1000w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/PXL_20211222_065347889.jpeg 1600w, https://wabisabitravel.com/content/images/2022/01/PXL_20211222_065347889.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>If you&apos;re used to using your phone to navigate anywhere, including your own home city/country, then you&apos;re definitely going to need it when you arrive in Iceland.</p><p>Picking up a SIM card for data/internet is pretty easy and affordable. However, I didn&apos;t want to fuss with SIM cards because they are so tiny and you can easily misplace them and then you&apos;re screwed when you return home.</p><p>Instead, I got I got a &quot;pocket Wi-Fi&quot; device from <a href="https://iceland.trawire.com/">Trawire</a>, which was delivered to a gift shop near my hotel. It needs to be charged every night, or turned off when you&apos;re not using it so it saves battery. It&apos;s basically like a cell phone with a SIM card in it, always on HotSpot mode (except you cannot call or browse the internet with it). It worked out to be about $12 CAD a day, and it would&apos;ve been cheaper had I reserved it more than 2 days in advance.</p><p>After you&apos;re done with it, you return it to any post office box (there are 2 at the airport) when you&apos;re done. The device comes with a box that has postage-paid.</p><p>While hotel WiFi might be enough for some, it really helped me get my bearing and find places I wanted to visit within the city and in the very remote parts of Iceland. I highly recommend pre-booking your device so you can pick it up at the airport and use it right away.</p><h2 id="lesson-5-take-the-flybus-from-the-airport-to-the-city">Lesson 5: Take the FlyBus from the airport to the city</h2><p>I used <a href="https://www.re.is/tour/flybus/">FlyBus Airport Transfer</a> to catch my shuttle to the city. Their tickets are flexible in terms of when you catch the shuttle (due to arrival flights potentially having delays), but strict in the time they pick you up to go back to the airport.</p><p>The lowest rate drops you off at the bus terminal, and from there you can walk to your hotel or Airbnb. This is a good option if your accommodation is less than a 10 minute walk. If you&apos;re travelling in the winter, and you arrive in the city around 9:00 am, it&apos;s going to still be dark. And if you have no WiFi or offline maps on your phone, it can be a challenge to find your hotel. </p><p>I suggest booking a hotel that is a 15 minute walk max from the bus terminal (use Google Maps to estimate walking time). If it takes longer than that, walking around with your luggage can get aggravating (even if your luggage rolls, because some ground is uneven), so opt for the FlyBus Plus option (about $15 extra) where additional shuttles will take you close to your hotel.</p><p>The ride was comfortable, and it took only 45 minutes from pick-up to arrival to my hotel.</p><h2 id="lesson-6-harpa-is-a-great-place-to-kill-time-if-it-s-too-cold-to-wander-around">Lesson 6: Harpa is a great place to kill time if it&apos;s too cold to wander around</h2><p>Because check-in is 15:00/3:00 pm, and I arrived at 8:00 am, I dropped my luggage off at the front desk Alda Hotel on Laugavegur street. I chose this hotel for its central location, modern decor, and access to a hot tub (because my room only had a shower).

The tour was awesome. Ben was an excellent tour guide and kept everyone engaged with facts and history about Iceland while we ate. My favourite restaurant was Messinn where I tried mashed fish which is like mashed potatoes but made of fish. It was sooo good. The famous Icelandic hot dogs were delicious too, served with deep fried onion bits.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t recommend doing it the day you land in Iceland if you have an overnight flight.

I know in an earlier post I led you all to think I only brought 1 lens, which was the 20mm f/2.8, but, surprise! I ended up bringing the 16mm f/2.8 and the nifty 50mm f/1.8. I also packed a 70-300mm but reserved that for landscape shots on the Ring Road which I&apos;ll share later on.
