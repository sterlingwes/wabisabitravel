              <p>Gosh, where do I begin?</p>
              <p>Okay, I'll start with why.</p>
              <p>
                Ten months ago, I was in solo traveling in Switzerland when I
                got an anxious text from my brother:
              </p>
              <p>
                "Rammstein tickets for 2023 stadium tour goes on sale tomorrow!"
              </p>
              <p>
                Because tickets were going on sale at 10 AM, Central Europe
                Time, and I happened to be in that time zone, I figured I was
                the best person to purchase said tickets.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, I've never visited Berlin before. Never really had a
                reason to. Except for Rammstein.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've been a fan of their music for over 20 years. I've never
                seen them perform live. Until now.
              </p>
              <p>Alright, more on Rammstein later.</p>
              <hr />
              <p>
                I booked my flight through Icelandair and did a 3 night stopover
                in Iceland on my way from Toronto. More on that stopover later.
              </p>
              <p>
                The flight from Iceland to Berlin was smooth, but boy, was I in
                for a heatwave! Especially coming from Iceland (Reykjanes
                peninsula) where the hottest temp was 20˚C, I was boiling in my
                long sleeves and long pants.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm going to go through my trip by category, rather than a
                chronological itinerary:
              </p>
              <h2 id="hotels">Hotels</h2>
              <p>
                I checked into Mondrian Suites near Checkpoint Charlie. Only
                stayed here for a night because I had mixed up dates and messed
                up. My stay was only 85 Euros, or $125 CAD. There was NO AIR
                CONDITIONING. I was boiling and could not get good sleep at
                night.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the rest of my stay in Berlin, I stayed at
                <a
                  href="https://www.easyhotel.com/hotels/germany/berlin/berlin-hackescher-markt"
                  >easyHotel in Hackescher Markt</a
                >. It's a hotel chain by the same low cost airline, easyJet. And
                you guessed it – they charge for every little thing. But I'm a
                no-frills kind of gal. I don't need daily room cleaning; I don't
                even need a hair dryer. And yes, the hotel rooms do not have
                hair dryers. There are no toiletries except hand soap (and I'm
                pretty sure the body wash is the same liquid as the hand soap).
              </p>
              <p>
                They only give you 1 towel and 1 bath mat towel. You can request
                more and they won't charge you for that. If you need a hair
                dryer, you rent it for a 10 Euros deposit and you get that money
                back if you give it back (it's not worth keeping, trust me).
              </p>
              <p>
                They also charge you 3 Euros to leave your bag locked in a
                locker if you happen to arrive earlier than your check-in time.
                Yup. Every little thing. I don't mind though! There's a lot of
                "extras" that I really don't need. I am particular about my
                toiletries anyway, so I don't need hotel-offered things.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I travel solo, all I care about is having a clean, safe,
                private room with a clean private bathroom that I don't need to
                share with everyone else. Everything else is a bonus.
              </p>

                  <a href="https://freabakery.de/">FREA Bakery</a>: one of the
                  best vegan bakeries I've ever visited. All espresso-based
                  drinks come made with oat milk by default – which is a DREAM.

                  >: right across the street from easyHotel in Hackescher Markt
                  and I went there twice during my trip. It was just an easy
                  option for a decent flat white and sweet treat (plain glazed
                  donuts – I'm boring, whatever)

                  the most filling and cheapest food options. Pho, banh mi
                  sandwiches, and tofu salads were so comforting to have when I
                  craved Vietnamese food.

              <p>
                Authentic run-of-the-mill German beer isn't the greatest. Trust
                me on this. Here are the spots for quality craft beer:

                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.themutedhorn.com/">Muted Horn</a>: owners
                  are from Canada, so there were a lot of familiar options from
                  Toronto (Bellwoods Brewery, Blood Brothers). They are also an
                  independent craft beer bottle shop. Canadian craft beer is
                  sold at a steep premium (2x) so unless you're an expat missing
                  home, I would suggest you buy it in Toronto. For example, a
                  500 mL bottle of Grandma's Boy from Bellwoods was selling for
                  18,50 Euros ($27 CAD), whereas in Toronto it's $14 CAD.

                I did a couple day tours. A craft beer one and a bicycle tour.
                Both were fine, but they were hosted by expats. Nothing wrong
                with that, but I was not super keen on their perspective as
                expats and preferred to learn from someone who had grown up in
                Berlin and could share their experiences of how Berlin evolved
                since their childhood.

                  night. Other tour groups have bigger groups and it can feel
                  like you're part of a lumbering group of annoying tourists, so
                  I recommend smaller group sizes if you can inquire in advance.
