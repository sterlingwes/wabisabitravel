              <p>
                It has been over 2 years since my last international trip (which
                was <a href="../tag/japan/index.html">Japan</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                To say I'm excited is a grave understatement. And yes, I am
                relishing in the preparation and packing parts, too!
              </p>
              <p>
                I've never been to Iceland. My brother visited a couple years
                ago, and he said it's one of those places you have to revisit
                because there's always more to see. I liken that sentiment when
                I visited <a href="../tag/japan/index.html">Japan</a> in
                February and again in November (yes, in the same year!).
              </p>
              <p>
                I've watched countless of videos about Iceland that I think I've
                consumed about 100 hours worth of content and I'm as ready as
                I'll ever be. I promised myself to stop watching any more and to
                leave a sliver of surprise and delight for the trip. But I'm a
                prepper at heart and need to reduce ambiguity (can you tell I
                hate surprises?).
              </p>
              <p>
                To help me stop thinking about Iceland before the trip (because
                it's driving me up the wall), I'm going to braindump everything
                I've been doing to prep for this trip so I can put it to rest
                and perhaps use it as a packing list when the time comes.
              </p>

                Research and build out your itinerary
              </h2>
              <p>
                Before I even pack, I research the destinations I'm going to
                visit and build out a rough itinerary so I know what I might
                need for those destinations.
              </p>

              </h3>
              <p>
                In the above itinerary, I know I have to pack for some pretty
                cold weather. Akureyri is located in northern Iceland and
                temperatures in December/January reach -5˚C or colder with
                windchill. I'll need to make sure I have a windproof and
                waterproof jacket and pants. In the pockets of them, I'll have
                my toque/hat, gloves, and scarf.

              <h2 id="checked-luggage">Checked Luggage</h2>
              <p>I'm not a carry-on only person. I'll just say that.</p>
              <p>
                I tried to do the minimalist, ultra-light packing trend that has
                taken the internet by storm, but it just does not work for me.
                Here's why:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I spent time (that could've been spent exploring) buying
                  clothing I didn't pack
                </li>
                <li>I was tired of doing laundry every other day</li>
                <li>I couldn't leave room for souvenirs</li>
                <li>
                  My flight tickets typically include 1 checked luggage, so why
                  not use what I paid for?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I'm not saying I enjoy overpacking or lugging around a big
                suitcase. I just prefer to have the option to bring home
                souvenirs. I enjoy buying local liquids (lol) that need to be
                checked, and I have a penchant for acquiring local bulky
                sweaters and purses. Sure, sounds materialistic, but that's what
                I value and I am okay with that.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I packed ultra-light and hated it, I ended up purchasing
                this Muji suitcase in Tokyo (also available online worldwide)
                which is the perfect size:

                It measures 70cm x 45cm x 25cm (27.5 in x 17.7 in x 9.8 in). So
                it needs to be checked-in and cannot be carried-on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though, I probably would've purchased one in Canada before my
                trip had I known ultra-light packing was not for me. Do your
                research–maybe an Away or Monos suitcase will be better for you.
                Or the cheapest one you can find at Winners or local department
                store! At the end of the day, it just holds your clothes, it's
                possible that airlines can lose it, so don't sweat about it too
                much.
              </p>
              <h3 id="prepare-to-lose-everything-in-checked-luggage">
                Prepare to lose everything in checked luggage
              </h3>
              <p>
                Anything that gets separated from you has the possibility of
                going lost forever. So whatever I packed in this luggage are
                things that I'm "okay with losing". I might be sad or
                disappointed, but most things are just things – replaceable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, do not pack anything you can't replace in here, like
                one-of-a-kind designer clothing or heirloom jewelry (unless
                you're okay with losing it forever).
              </p>
              <p>Underpack, if you're a souvenir acquirer.</p>
              <p>
                If you're like me, you like to bring back local goods. I always
                find liquor, cookies, sweaters, or purses (which are bulky)
                wherever I travel, so I plan ahead and leave half my suitcase
                empty for this stuff.

              <p>
                As long as it meets your airline carry-on size restrictions,
                pack an empty carry-on-sized bag (in your personal item or
                checked luggage). If your flight allows 1 carry-on + 1 personal
                item, and if you're checking your luggage + bringing 1 personal
                item on the plane (like me), then you'll be ready to fill out
                that carry-on allowance when returning home. This will unlock
                more space when you're returning. You can pack anything in it,
                like a jacket you don't want to wear indoors or a big stuffed
                toy. Basically:

              <p>
                My rule of thumb: everything you pack should be worn 3 times.
                I'll be gone for 11 days (round it out to 12), so I should bring
                no more than 4 pieces of everything. Pack fewer if you are okay
                with doing a bit of daily hand-wash laundry.
              </p>
              <p>
                This list does not include clothing I'll wear on the plane which
                I'll cover in another list later.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>3 base layer tops (+1 worn on the plane)</li>
                <li>
                  3 sweaters (1 fancy, 1 sweatshirt for sleeping, 1 cardigan to
                  layer, +1 worn on the plane)
                </li>
                <li>
                  3 bottoms (1 fancy leggings, 1 activewear leggings, 1
                  sweatpants for sleeping +1 worn on the plane)
                </li>
                <li>
                  3 pairs of wool socks (SmartWool socks wash and dry very well,

              </ul>
              <p>
                For footwear: I will only wear my hiking boots. I have 3 fancy
                restaurant experiences booked and I'm still going to go in with
                my hiking boots – it'll be fine! Your feet are tucked underneath
                the table and they're not going to serve you sludge for not
                wearing fancy footwear. If you really want to bring another

                larger luggage.
              </p>
              <p>
                For my personal item, I bring a school backpack and inside I put
                in a smaller purse for day trips and I may leave the backpack
                empty or with non-valuables in the hotel.

              <p>
                For the start of the trip, I bring anything I don't want to lose
                or spend time replacing.
              </p>
              <ul>

                  Photography gear (not only potentially expensive, but buying
                  international versions of gear is not something I want to put

                </li>
                <li>
                  AirPods/noise cancelling headphones (airlines provide the

                  over-the-ear kind)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Medication (may not apply to you, but I know it would for
                  others – pack at least 2 week's worth extra in case you're
                  stranded somewhere due to Covid. Also bring a doctor's
                  prescription for more, and check that your travel insurance
                  covers prescriptions filled internationally or budget
                  accordingly.)

                And of course, obvious things you should
                <strong>always</strong> pack in your personal item: passport and
                phone.

              <h3 id="wear-on-the-plane-list">"Wear on the plane" list</h3>
              <p>
                The things you wear on the plane should be considered as
                articles you can re-wear on your trip. I wear layers so I can
                add/remove depending on how hot/cold a space or the plane will
                be:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Tank top base layer</li>
                <li>Long-sleeved base layer</li>
                <li>Zip-up fleece jacket/cardigan/sweater</li>
                <li>Leggings or fleece pants</li>
                <li>
                  Snow/waterproof pants (leave room in the personal item to pack
                  this away if you don't want to look silly, but wearing them to
                  the airport might be necessary if there's a literal snow storm
                  when you arrive)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Snow or hiking boots (pack slippers in a plastic bag if you
                  prefer to wear these on the plane)
                </li>
                <li>Wool socks</li>
                <li>Parka (windproof and waterproof)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If it grosses you out to re-wear clothes you wore on the plane,
                then wash them as soon as you get to your hotel room so they
                have time to hang dry.
              </p>
              <h3 id="pro-tips">Pro tips</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Choose daywear that you could also comfortably wear as
                  pajamas, rather than packing separate pieces (I like
                  sweatpants and sweatshirts)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use the hotel shampoos/soaps to wash your clothing, saves
                  space in your luggage unless you aren't sure how the soap will
                  react to any special fabrics
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use hangers to hang dry your items, or if you're not sure if
                  there will be any, pack a travel washing line
                </li>
                <li>
                  In case you get sick, pack your own vitamin C or painkillers
                  because trying to find them in a local pharmacy might be
                  challenging and/or expensive. Formulas may differ from your
                  home country or what you're used to, so better to err on the
                  side of caution.

                Prepping activities for each day
              </h2>
              <p>For me, activities are basically 2 things:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Eating and drinking things (ok this is 2 in 1)</li>
                <li>Seeing things</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                I'll cover #1 for the most part, because I know about that
                really well :o)
              </p>
              <p>
                I'll be spending 2-3 days at the start and end of the trip in
                the city of Reykjavik. In between, everything will be planned by
                a tour guide because I personally wanted to remove the mental
                energy of planning for the Ring Road trip. I'm also not driving
                even though I could; I just don't want to take chances in the
                winter time when road conditions could be compromised and heard
                it's no joke out there.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you might've heard, Iceland can be very expensive. If
                consuming alcohol is something you like to do (like me), then my
                brother (who visited previous) has two money-saving tips:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Buy alcohol at the start of the trip at the Duty Free airport.
                  It is 5x cheaper than buying it in the city.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Buy drinks at the bars during Happy Hour. Download the Appy
                  Hour app to find out all the places that participate.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                For restaurants, at every travel destination, I rely on Google
                Maps and sort by star rating (I'm more inclined to check out
                anything that has 4.5 stars and above, and at least 10 reviews).
              </p>
              <p>
                From my research, dining out is expensive with meals starting at
                3000 ISK (around $30 Canadian), but a really good meal is not
                that far off (probably an extra $10). So if you're stuck between
                having a really good meal and low-end meal, the internet
                recommends just go for the really good meal.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you aren't into dining out, you can book a hotel or hostel
                room with cooking facilities as there are grocery stores all
                over to get your fixings for a good meal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Obviously there is more to do than eating and drinking, but
                you're going to do it 3x a day, so it's one of the most
                important things to think about.
              </p>

                Traveling to Iceland in the Winter means higher chances of
                seeing the Northern Lights! And if you want to capture the
                Northern Lights, here is a super short gear packing list:

                  Wide aperture, wide angle lens (I'm taking a 20mm f/2.8,
                  although a 16-35mm f/2.8 might be good too)
                </li>
                <li>Tripod</li>
                <li>
                  DSLR or mirrorless body with a full-frame sensor or something
                  with good low-light performance (I'm bringing my Canon 6D from
                  2012)

                That's it! Oh, and maybe patience, warm gloves/hat, and a lot of

                before you go.

                For some people, taking a bulky DSLR is a No. But me, it is a
                Strong Yes. I'll cover that in another post.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted in my itinerary above, I'll be visiting Ring Road on
                days 4-10, and I'll be on a tour with a small group, so most
                activities will be planned for me. In case you're going on your
                own or doing the camper van thing, aim for 1-2 big things and
                try not to pack too many activities at once. Leave room for
                serendipity!

                      months ago, I was in solo traveling in Switzerland when I
                      got an anxious text from my brother: "Rammstein tickets
                      for 2023 stadium tour goes on sale tomorrow!" Because
                      tickets were going on sale at 10 AM, Central Europe

                      Castles! History! Outlander! All valid reasons to visit
                      Scotland. I visited with my partner, mother-in-law, and
                      brother-in-law in spring 2023 so I'll have tips here on
                      traveling with an adult family. I knew nothing about
                      Scotland or its history before my trip, and as someone who
                      soaks in history differently,
