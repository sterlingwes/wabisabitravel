                People will always have an opinion when it comes to talking
                about money. How to make it, how to spend it, and whether
                something is "worth it".
              </p>
              <p>
                I got into a debate in an Instagram reel (lol) about how much it
                costs to travel (from North America to Europe). The original
                poster said it cost her about $3500 for 2 weeks with a friend. I
                chimed in to say "that's accurate, and it cost me closer to
                $5000 as a solo traveller who stayed alone in hotels in
                Switzerland". I thought it was helpful to share a different
                side! And for some reason, the internet did not like that 😂
              </p>
              <p>
                I had one random person with a protected account tell me that I
                was promoting "luxury travel" and that she's solo travelling
                Germany and her Airbnb only cost $500 for 2 weeks. Great! I'm
                happy for you. But don't label my experience as luxury 💀
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe I needed to preface every money-related thing with this:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>I am a person who has worked in the tech industry</li>
                <li>I am privileged (I have been able to save up)</li>
                <li>I prefer to stay in hotels with a private bathroom</li>
                <li>
                  I prefer to eat out instead of cooking while I'm on holiday
                </li>
                <li>
                  I prefer direct flights with reserved seats as opposed to
                  flights with connections/layovers/low-cost airlines
                </li>
                <li>
                  I prefer visiting European countries with higher standards of
                  living where a beer costs $20
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Also, note, I am flying to Europe from North America. Across an
                ocean. Of course it's going to cost more. If you're already
                living in Europe and you're taking a train to another European
                country, you can't tell me "oH bUt I oNlY speNd 10 Euros a dAy
                oN MY TRIP".
              </p>
              <p>
                I live in the middle of nowhere where I cook all meals. I rarely
                eat out. So why would I do something I already do the rest of
                the 50 weeks a year? I need to give myself a break!
              </p>
              <p>
                Missing connections and sitting in the middle seat of a 3-seater
                is not fun. I know my limits of wakefulness. I know lack of my
                ability to sleep on planes. I will pay money to avoid or
                mitigate the shittiness of that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Budgets hit nerves because it is a comparison rabbit hole.
                People apply their biases, privileges, and circumstances to the
                conversation. People sometimes fish for compliments over how
                they've been able to "price hack" and be a "smart spender". But
                is spending $30 more a night for a hotel room going to harm your
                long-term financial position? Sure, it adds up. But at the end
                of the day, it's about what you value (to spend more) and what
                you're willing to put up with (to save).
              </p>
              <p>
                I always cost out my travels. I spreadsheet everything down to
                the coffee I'll buy every day. And I add 25% for incidentals or
                things I didn't expect to come up. I spend more, and I do it
                responsibly. I set a limit and play within it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Travel is a choice and privilege. It can be a luxury, depending
                on who you ask. And if you want my opinion and match my style of
                travel, it's going to cost the above. If you think I overspend,
                great! That's not going to change my choices. You can do it your
                way. No one dies in the end!

                      got an anxious text from my brother: "Rammstein tickets

                      traveling with an adult family. I knew nothing about
                      Scotland or its history before my trip, and as someone who
                      soaks in history differently,
